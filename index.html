            <p>What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Next, please.</p>

            <p>Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? What did your mother ever see in that kid? Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.</p>

            <p>It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hi. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him.</p>
