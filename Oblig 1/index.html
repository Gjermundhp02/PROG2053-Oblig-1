            <p>What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Next, please.</p>

            <p>What a nightmare. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Ahh. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.</p>

            <p>It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hi. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him.</p>
